Robust 3D Distributed Formation Control with Collision Avoidance for Multirotor Aerial Vehicles.

Distributed control strategy for a team of agents to autonomously achieve a 3D desired formation, adopting also a fully distributed collision avoidance strategy. Specifically, this approach was validated on a team of quadrotors.
